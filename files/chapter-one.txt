Strike for love and strike for fear.
There's beauty and there's Danger here.

Come on, Sven!
Elsa. Psst
Elsa!
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.
Anna, go back to sleep.
I just can't. The sky's awake, so I'm awake,
so we have to play.
...Go play by yourself.
Do you want to build a snowman?
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Do the magic! Do the magic!
Ready? Uhhm...
This is amazing!
Watch this!
Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.
I love you, Olaf.
Al'right. Catch me! - Gotcha!
Again! Wait!
Slow down!
Anna!
Anna?
Mama! Papa!
You Ok, Anna. I Got you.
Elsa, what have you done?
This is getting out of hand!
It was an accident. I'm sorry, Anna.
- She's ice cold.
- I know where we have to go.
Ice?
Faster, Sven!
Sven!
Please... Help!
My daughter!
He is the King!
Trolls...?
Shush. I'm trying to listen.
Cuties. I'm gonna keep you.
Your Majesty!
Born with the powers or cursed?
Born. And they're getting stronger.
You are lucky it wasn't her heart.
The heart is not so easily changed,
But the head can be persuaded.
Do what you must.
I recommend we remove all magic,
even memories of magic to be safe...
But don't worry, I'll leave the fun.
She will be okay.
But she won't remember I have powers?
- It's for the best.
- Listen to me, Elsa,
your power will only grow.
There is beauty in it...
But also great danger.
You must learn to control it.
Fear will be your enemy.
No. We'll protect her. She can learn to control it. I'm sure.
Until then,
we'll lock the gates. We'll reduce the staff.
We will limit her contact with people
and keep her powers hidden from everyone...
including Anna.
Elsa?
Do you want to build a snowman?
Come on let's go and play.
I never see you anymore. Come out the door.
It's like you've gone away.
We used to be best buddies.
And now we're not. I wish you would tell me why.
Do you want to build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman.
Go away, Anna.
...Okay bye.
The gloves will help. See...
- Conceal it.
- Don't feel it.
Don't let it show.
Do you want to build a snowman?
Or ride our bike around the hall?
I think some company is overdue...
I've started talking to the pictures on the walls.
Hang in there, Joan.
It gets a little lonely all these empty rooms.
Just watching the hours tick by.
I'm scared. It's getting stronger.
Getting upset only makes it worse.
Calm down.
No. Don't touch me. Please. I don't want to hurt you.
See you in two weeks.
- Do you have to go?
- You'll be fine, Elsa.
Elsa?
Please, I know you're in there.
People are asking where you've been,
They say have courage and I'm trying to...
I'm right out here for you. Just let me in.
We only have each other.
It's just you and me.
What are we gonna do?
Do you want to build a snowman?
Three Years Later.
Welcome to Arendelle! Thank you, Sir!
Watch your Steps please. The Gates Will opening Soon.
Why do I have to wear this?
Because the Queen has come of age.
It's Coronation Day!
That's not my fault.
- What do you want, Sven?
- Give me a snack!
What's the magic word? Please!
A..a... a... a! Share!
I can't believe they're finally opening up the gates!
And for a whole day!
Faster, Persi!
Ah, Arendelle, our most mysterious trade partner.
Open those gates so I may unlock your secrets
and exploit your riches.
...Did I just say that out loud?
Oh, me sore eyes can't wait to.
See the Queen and the Princess.
I bet they're absolutely lovely.
I bet they are beautiful.
Princess Anna...?
...Huh? Yeah?
- Sorry to wake you, ma'am but...
- No, no, no. You didn't.
I've been up for hours.
Who is it?
It's still me, ma'am. The gates will open soon.
Time to get ready. Of course!
Ready for what?
Your sister's coronation, ma'am.
My sister's cor-neration...
It's coronation day!
It's coronation day!
The window is open! So's that door!
I didn't know they did that anymore.
Who knew we owned 8000 salad plates...?
For years I have roamed these empty halls.
Why have a ballroom with no balls?
Finally, they're opening up the gates!
There'll be real, actual people
It'll be totally strange.
But wow am I so ready for this change!
For the first time in forever,
There'll be music, there'll be light.
For the first time in forever,
I'll be dancing through the night.
Don't know if I'm elated or gassy,
But I'm somewhere in that zone.
'Cause for the first time in forever,
I won't be alone. I can't wait to meet everyone...
What if I meet "the one"?
Tonight, imagine me gown and all.
Fetchingly draped against the wall.
The picture of sophisticated Grace.
I suddenly see him standing there,
a beautiful stranger tall and fair.
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face!
But then we laugh and talk all evening,
Which is totally bizarre.
Nothing like the life I've led so far.
For the first time in forever,
There'll be magic, There'll be fun.
For the first time in forever,
I could be noticed by someone.
And I know it is totally crazy.
To dream I'd find romance.
But for the first time in forever,
At least I've got a chance!
Don't let them in. Don't let them see.
Be the good girl You always have to be.
Conceal. Don't feel.
Put on a show.
Make one wrong move and everyone will know.
But it's only for today.
It's only for today! It's agony to wait.
It's agony to wait.
Tell the guards to open up the...
The gate!
For the first time in forever.
Don't let them in don't let them see
I'm getting what I'm dreaming of.
Be the good girl you always have to be.
A chance to change my Only world.
Conceal. Conceal. Don't feel.
- A chance to find true love
- Don't See, Don't Feel, Don't Let them know.
I know it all ends tomorrow,
So it has to be today!
'Cause for the first time in forever...
For the first time in forever!
Nothing's in my way!
Hey! I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?
Hey!
I-ya, no. No. I'm okay. Are you sure?
Yeah, I just wasn't looking where I was going.
- But I'm great, actually.
- Oh, thank goodness.
Oh... Umm...
Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.
Princess Anna of Arendelle. Princess...?
My Lady.
Hi... again.
Oh boy.
Ha. This is awkward. Not you're awkward,
but just because we're...I'm awkward.
You're gorgeous. Wait, what?
I'd like to formally apologize for
hitting the Princess of Arendelle with my horse...
And for every moment after.
No. No-no. It's fine. I'm not THAT Princess.
I mean, if you'd hit my sister Elsa, that would be...
'Cuz, you know...
Hello.
But, lucky you, it's-it's just me.
Just you?
...The bells. The coronation.
I... I...
I better go. I have to...I better go.
Bye!
Your Majesty, The gloves.
(formal, in Old Norse) Sehm hon hell drr in-um hell-gum Ayg-num Ok
krund ee thes-um hellgah Stahth, ehk teh frahm fur-ear Uthear...
...Queen Elsa of Arendelle.
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.
Princess Anna of Arendelle!
Here? Are you sure? I do not think I suppose to...Okay.
Hi.
Hi me...? Oh. Um. Hi.
You look beautiful...Thank you.
You look beautifuller. I mean, not Fuller.
You don't look Fuller, but more beautiful.
Thank you.
So, this is what a party looks like?
It's warmer than I thought.
And what is that amazing smell?
... Chocolate.
Your Majesty. The Duke of Weaseltown.
Weselton. The Duke of Weselton..
Your Majesty,
As your closest partner in trade,
It seems only fitting that I offer you.
Your first dance as Queen.
Thank you... Only I don't dance.
But my sister does.
Lucky you...Oh, I don't think...
If you swoon, let me know, I'll catch you.
Sorry.
Like an agile peacock...
Speaking of, so great to have the gates open.
Why did they shut them in the first place?
Do you know the reason? Hmm?
No. No...
Oh, all right. Hang on.
They don't call me "the little dipper" for nothing.
Like a chicken...with the face of a monkey... I fly.
Let me know when you're ready for another round, M'Lady.
Well, he was sprightly.
Especially for a man in heels.
Are you okay? I've never been better.
This is so nice.
I wish it could be like this all the time.
Me too...
But it can't.
Why not? If...It just can't.
Excuse me for a minute.
Glad I caught you. Hans!
I often had the whole parlor to myself to slide...Oops. Sorry.
... Your physique helps I'm sure too.
What's this? I was born with it,
Although I dreamt I was kissed by a troll.
I like it.
Yeah, The whole thing! You got it.
Okay wait, wait. So you have how many brothers?
Twelve older brothers.
Three of them pretended I was invisible...
literally... for two years.
- That's horrible.
- It's what brothers do.
... And sisters.
Elsa and I were really close when we were little.
But then, one day she just shut me out, and...
And I never knew why.
I would never shut you out.
Okay, can I just say something crazy?
I love crazy.
All my life has been a series of doors in my face.
And then suddenly I bump into you.
I was thinking the same thing, because like...
I've been searching my whole life to find my own place.
And maybe it's the party talking,
Or the chocolate fondue.
But with you...
I found my place.
I see your face.
And it's nothing like I've ever known before.
Love is an open... door!
Love is an open... door...Door...
Love is an open... door...
With you! With you!
Love is an open door.
I mean it's crazy. What?
We finish each other's...Sandwiches!
That's what I was gonna say!
I've never met someone...Who thinks so much like me.
Jinx... jinx again.
You and I were just meant to be.
Say goodbye.
To the pain of the past.
We don't have to feel it anymore!
Love is an open... door!
Love is an open door!
Life can be so much more...with you! With you!
Love is an open... door.
Can I say something crazy...?
Will you marry me?
Can I just say something even crazier?
Yes.
Oops! Pardon. Sorry. Can we just get around you there?
Thank you. Oh, there she is.
Elsa! I mean... Queen...
Me again. May I present,
Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.
Your Majesty.
We would like...your blessing...
of... our marriage!
Marriage...? Yes!
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
Well, We haven't worked out all the details ourselves.
We'll need a few days to plan the ceremony.
Of course we'll have soup,
roast, and ice cream and then...
Wait. Would we live here?
Here? Absolutely!
Anna...
Oh, we can invite all twelve of your brothers to stay with us...
What? No, no, no, no, no.
Of course we have the room. I don't know. Some of them must...
Wait. Slow down.
No one's brothers are staying here.
No one is getting married.
Wait, what?
May I talk to you, please. Alone.
No. Whatever you have to say, you...
you can say to both of us.
Fine. You can't marry a man you just met.
You Can if it's true love.
Anna, what do you know about true love?
More than you. All you know is how to shut people out.
You asked for my blessing, but my answer is no.
Now, Excuse me.
Your Majesty, if I may ease your...
No, you may not. And I-I think you should go.
The party is over. Close the gates.
Yes, Your Majesty.
What? Elsa, no. No, wait!
Give me my glove!
Elsa, please. Please. I can't live like this anymore.
... Then leave.
... What did I ever do to you?!
Enough, Anna.
No. Why? Why do you shut me out?!
Why do you shut the world out?!
What are you so afraid of?!
I said, enough!
Sorcery. I knew there was
something dubious going on here.
Elsa...?
There she is.
Your Majesty! Long live the Queen! Queen Elsa...
Come drink with us.
Queen Elsa.
Your Majesty? Are you all right?
There she is! Stop her!
Please, just stay away from me.
Stay away!
Monster... Monster!
Elsa!
Elsa...
Wait, Please!
Elsa, Stop!
Anna! No.
The Fjord.
Snow?
Yes, snow!
Are you all right? No.
Did you know? No.
Look! It's snowing! It's snowing!
The Queen has cursed this land!
She must be stopped!
You have to go after her...Wait, no!
You! Is there sorcery in you, too?
Are you a monster, too?
No. No. I'm completely ordinary.
That's right she is.
... In the best way.
And my sister's not a monster.
She nearly killed me.
You slipped on ice...Her ice!
It was an accident. She was scared.
She didn't mean it. She didn't mean any of this...
Tonight was my fault. I pushed her.
So I'm the one that needs to go after her.
What? Yeah. Bring me my horse, please.
Anna, no. It's too dangerous.
Elsa's not dangerous.
I'll bring her back, And I'll make this right.
I'm coming with you...No.
I need you here to take care of Arendelle.
On my honor.
I leave Prince Hans in charge!
Are you sure you can trust her?
I don't want you getting hurt.
She's my sister,
She would never hurt me.
The Snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
Not a footprint to be seen.
A kingdom of isolation.
And it looks like I'm the Queen.
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside.
Couldn't keep it in, Heaven knows I tried...
Don't let them in, Don't let them see,
Be the good girl you always have to be.
Conceal, Don't feel, Don't let them know.
Well, Now they know.
Let it go. Let it go.
Can't hold it back anymore.
Let it go. Let it go.
Turn away and Slam the door.
I don't care what they're going to say.
Let the storm rage on.
The cold never bothered me anyway.
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small.
And the fears that once controlled me.
Can't get to me at all.
It's time to see what I can do,
To test the limits and Break through.
No right, No wrong, No rules for me...
I'm free!
Let it go! Let it go!
I am one with the wind and sky.
Let it go! Let it go!
You'll never see me cry.
Here I Stand And...
Here I'll stay.
Let the storm rage on...
My power flurries through the air into the ground.
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around.
And one thought crystallizes like An icy blast...
I'm never going back,
The Past is in the Past!
Let it go! Let it go!
And I'll rise like the break of Dawn.
Let it go! Let it go!
That perfect girl is gone.
Here I stand in the light of day.
Let the storm rage on!
The cold never bothered me anyway.
Elsa! Elsa!
Elsa, It's me, Anna...
Your sister who didn't mean to make you freeze the summer.
